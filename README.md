Title: Automatic measurement of acetabular index applying deep learning algorithm to detect developmental dysplasia of the hip

Abstract: Developmental dysplasia of the hip could cause patients to suffer from a disease for a lifetime. Early detection of these problems is very important. However, because of abrasion of anatomical structures, it is difficult to be detected in X-Rays. Acetabular index is a significant angle related to the diagnosis of developmental dysplasia of the hip. In this paper, we develop an automatic system including landmark detection and angle measurement to diagnose developmental dysplasia of the hip. Firstly, we propose a novel mixed spatial information attention module to capture the height-channel and the weight-channel feature information to improve the accuracy of landmark detection. Then according to the coordinates of landmarks, the acetabular index is calculated to detect developmental dysplasia of the hip. Experimental results show that, our landmark detection algorithm achieves excellent performances in an opening source pelvis X-Ray image dataset including 8 landmarks, with an average point-to-point error of 3.1350 mm, as compared to other landmark detection models. In a multi-center private dataset, we apply the landmark detection model trained in the opening source dataset to determine the coordinates of upper acetabulum rim and innermost point of subchondral sclerosis to calculate acetabular index. The values of accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score of detecting developmental dysplasia of the hip are 84.43%, 85.71%, 87.5% and 86.60%. The results show that our method has the high detection accuracy.
